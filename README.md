# PyLn
PyLn is a Python AI bot project :

There is actually much more Todo things than the actual program itself.

#### Internet questions // Out of User System
It's actually a kind of curl.calling evi.com, for questions requiring internet database knowledge.
I'll probably make it as a Rest API.

#### User Interaction System
(In todo thing). I have to create class and function to seperate the curl.calling to internet and the local requests.
It should be like a local library which contains all the different programs and functions such as, "battery, uptime, update" and so on.


I'm not pretending to be a good programmer or unix user, so help and tips will be appreciated. 

#### Next ToDo :
- Create Dictionary Os_Func

I'd like to make an autonome database straight on a distant server to implement those following features :Â 
- Make history ask and answer
- Be able to search, sort the knowledge general/user database
- Implement the way to set local database interface (UserLan)
- Know if ask request is already in base {{if YES}} not make a WAN request but Server to Client

### The Database structure : 
USER | DATE | QUESTION | ANSWER
